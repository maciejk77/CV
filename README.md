## Maciek Kurek

Previously highly acomplished digital marketer (gaming and telco) turned developer in March 2015 when I have decided to pursue my passion for technology by completing intensive coding bootcamp. My core commercial experience and interest lies in UI, Front End and JavaScript including Node.js on the back end. However, I am language agnostic and continuously learn new technologies as required.
